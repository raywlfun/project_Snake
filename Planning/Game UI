**Game User Interface**

Objective: Create a game window that continuously refreshes at a given frames per second constant
            -- Every frame should update the coordinates of the snake, as it is always moving
            -- Food object position is continuously updated at its given coordinates
            -- Game window should have fixed constant values:
                ( Colours - background, snake_body, food_object, score_display )
                ( Font / Text size - score_display, game_window captions )
                ( Grid_square_properties - grid_square_size, snake_body_size )
