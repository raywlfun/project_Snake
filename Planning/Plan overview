Snake body
- Data structure is a tuple (x_axis, y_axis)
    --> for every frame for the total length of the snake:
        - Remove coordinate for x_axis and y_axis as tail [-1]
        - Insert new coordinate for x_axis and y_axis as new position at head [0]

    --> increment snake length if snake body corresponds with fruit x_axis y_axis coordinates
