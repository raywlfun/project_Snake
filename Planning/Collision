**Collision function**

// Affected functions:
    - Snake movement
    - Check game status
    - Terminate game session

Objective: Check if:
            a - The snake head (index 0) positional coordinates == snake body coordinates
            b - The snake head positional coordinates == screen boundaries
    --> Should be called after movement functionalities
    --> If either of these checks are true:
        --> Call Terminate game session function

        Function is continuously called every time the game window refreshes (i.e. every time the snake moves)

[TEST] Primarily visual functionality test
--> See if game stops after check == True
    - after: colliding with body, colliding with screen boundaries
