** Movement function**

i. Should be grid-like
    --> Every movement should + / - the x / y axis coordinates of the snake
    --> Update positional coordinates every instance

ii. Continuously call this function to simulate smooth and automatic movement
    // Note: tKinter has a function to call a function after a specified amount of time
        --> See people using "root.after" to repeat movement functions
            -- Where "root" is the variable that calls the game window ("game_window" in this case).
