**Detecting Keypress**

// Affected functions:
    - Snake movement
    - Snake position

Objective: Program detects when a movement key is pressed,
            -- Call function to change direction if key pressed != current direction
                --> Adjust snake direction from the head if new direction
                    --> Insert snake head (x, y) position to start of index

            -- Snake cannot go from left to right, right to left, up to down, down to up
                --> [TEST] (Requires collision functionality):
                    --> Try to perform left to right, up to down movement:
                        - If not game_over:
                            - Test fail
                        if game_over:
                            - Test pass

// Note:
    - tkinter "bind" function to detect keypress
    - Some people use lambda function; look into this
